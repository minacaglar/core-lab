			Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, <span class="highlight"> instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface,</span> but without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows—only hard with luminous edges—and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas, a few years ago, I should have said "my universe:" but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things.

		<div class="mybox2">
			In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that there should be anything of what you call a "solid" kind; but I dare say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described them. On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least so as to distinguish one figure from another. Nothing was visible, nor could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of this I will speedily demonstrate.

			Place a penny<span class="one">1</span> on the middle of one of your tables<span class="two">2</span> in Space<span class="three">3</span>; and leaning over it, look down upon it. It will appear a circle.<span class="four">4</span>

			<div class="flexparent">
				<div class="circle1"><p>1</p></div>
				<div class="box1"><p>2</p></div>
				<div class="box2"><p>3</p></div>
				<div class="circle2"><p>4</p></div>
			</div>

			But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all, and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.
