				<h1>Baby Grand: Paul Sevigny’s Tribeca Hot Spot</h1>
			    <p>There are few people that have made New York night life special in the last few years and Paul Sevigny is definitely one of them. 
			    <br>
				Sevigny has a special talent accomplished by his culture, in create fun in very special atmospheres like you are dancing in the living room of your parents house.
				<br>
				This one is definitely a fancy home: “ Paul's Baby Grand” (at the South corner of the TriBeCa Grand Hotel), his latest gem, where the furniture and every detail that makes the interior was hand-picked by Sevigny himself who had his artist friends give the room its unique finishing touch.
				<br>
				You find Andrè's graffiti at the entrance and in the bathrooms and a conservatively hung collection of paintings on the walls of the artist Josh Smith. Every detail is so well curated and the drinks have names like "Bisou Bisou", "Jackie's cup", "Acapulco Sunset".
				<br>
				The place seems to belong in one of Aaron Slims' pictures and I can say that the pink bar – resembling a four-posted bed - is something we have never seen before … oh also: the staff wears uniforms designed by Paul’s sister, Chloe. Divine!</p>
